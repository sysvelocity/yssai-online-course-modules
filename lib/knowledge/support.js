// YSS_SUPPORT_CHAT_KNOWLEDGE_V1

export const supportChatKnowledge = String.raw`
System overview
- There are two separate Vercel apps:
  - the branded course website
  - the standalone AI modules app
- The website handles auth, admin, licensing, user management, usage tracking, and secure module launching.
- The modules app handles the AI Assist experiences.

Website behavior
- Users sign in on the course website with Supabase email/password auth.
- New users are invited by email and choose their own password.
- Users can request password reset links.
- If must_reset_password is true, the user must choose a new password before continuing.
- Admins can create organizations, add up to three approved email domains, create a seat-counted license, invite users, deactivate/reactivate users, force resets, and delete users.

Licensing and access
- Each organization has one active license and a shared seat pool.
- Users consume seats through license assignments.
- Licenses define which modules are allowed.
- The website mints a short-lived signed token before opening an AI Assist in the separate modules app.
- The modules app validates that token before granting access.
- If a license is inactive, expired, or does not allow a module, access is denied.
- Support chat is intended to be available to authenticated licensed users as a protected support surface.

Tracking and sessions
- The website records usage events in public.usage_events.
- Tracked events include login, module open, video play, AI Assist launch, download click, lesson completion toggle, and password reset completion.
- User sessions are tracked separately in public.user_sessions.
- Admin reporting uses those tables to show activity and last active information.

Module and AI Assist coverage
- Module 1: quiz on why a great story changes everything.
- Module 2: critique common sales story sins and related exercises.
- Module 3: current story evaluation exercise and bridge-line groundwork.
- Module 4: draft and refine customer issues addressed and outcomes delivered talking points.
- Module 5: review and refine differentiator talking points.
- Module 6: create applied outreach assets such as live calls, emails, voicemails, and conversational sales story examples.

AI Assist behavior and limits
- The modules app uses OpenAI and module-specific prompts.
- Built-in module knowledge is grounded in internal support or module knowledge, not internet browsing.
- Attachments can be uploaded and used as working material.
- Multiple attachments are supported in the modules app.
- Attachments are still retrieval-based, so they can sometimes be used less reliably than built-in in-context knowledge.
- Export behavior in the modules app works in two different ways:
  - For a specific AI Assist response, the user can use the copy icon directly underneath that response. The copy icon looks like two overlapping square or rectangle outlines. That copies just that one response.
  - For the whole chat session, the user can use the export icon at the very bottom of the screen in the footer area. The export icon looks like a document outline with a downward arrow. That exports the entire session into a document on the user's local computer.
- If a user asks how export works, explain the difference between copying one response with the copy icon and exporting the whole session with the footer export icon.
- The support assistant should describe known behavior without inventing features that are not currently implemented.

Helpful troubleshooting guidance
- If a user cannot access a module, check login status, active profile status, license assignment, license expiry, and whether the module is included in allowed_modules.
- If a user says an attachment was uploaded but the answer ignored it, explain that upload success does not always guarantee the model used attachment retrieval effectively on that turn.
- If a user asks why activity looks incomplete, note that usage tracking depends on tracked event types and dashboard query behavior.
- If a user asks which AI Assist to use, route them based on the module purpose listed above.
- If a user asks for internet research or unrelated help, explain that the assistant is limited to course and product support.
